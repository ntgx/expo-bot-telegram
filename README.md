# Telegram Bot for ICT Expo Ethiopia 2017

This is the official telegram bot for the first international ICT Expo in Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ (June 28 - July 02). Over 200,000 are expected to attend!

You can play with the bot [here](https://t.me/ictexpobot)

## Progress
- [x] Send Exhibitors, schedule, speakers, events, sponsors, floor plan
- [x] Use apiai to do NLP (smalltalk with the user and accepts commands, questions)
- [ ] Conversational form to register users for the lotto
- [ ] Set reminder feature for events and daily schedule
- [ ] Collect website, tel and logo of all exhibitors, logos for sponsors & urls for learn more on the speaker cards
- [ ] Show the github contributors within the bot
- [ ] After expo ends make it generic enough so anyone can just replace the JSON data and have a good starting point for a new expo, conference or exhibition bot

## Building and Deploying
Run `$ yarn` to install the dependencies and set these environment variables:

- **EXPO_BOT_TOKEN** - Talk to [Bot Father](https://t.me/botfather) to get your token
- **EXPO_API_AI_TOKEN** - Sign up on [apiai](https://api.ai) to get your token

Optional

- **EXPO_BOT_URI**
- **PORT**

You'll need the above two if you want to setup a webhook with telegram. Or you can just run the server locally by running `$ yarn start`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome...even during the expo! There will be space there to hack on the bots[1] together & to show anyone interested the basics. Contributors will be shown within the bot.
